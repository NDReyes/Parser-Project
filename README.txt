These are important notes regarding running the project.

To run it on Linux, in the directory of the project, type this command:

  make run

It would run the three basics tests already in the project. Any other tests would need to be added
to the makefile or run independently from the makefile.

Pictures of the results of each test can be found in the folder: Test Pictures.

Thank you!
